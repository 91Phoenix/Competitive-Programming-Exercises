# Competitive Programming

I started focusing on the competitive programming, cause I think it can open my mind. Nowadays there are a lot of SDE, which have nothing to do with the engineering. What does should differentiate us (computer enginners) from a standard developer? The desire to understand how actually is possible to make valuable solutions. The Design of a confortable development processes, making everything extensible, reusable. This is the main problem for the most of the companies. But what about the efficence?I think that this last thing is what actually makes Computer engineers a engineers, scientists. it is the join point between mathematic and SD. It makes the SD a more powerfull tool
